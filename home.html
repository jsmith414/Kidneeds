<P>Welcome to Kidneeds. The purpose of KIDNEEDS is to support families living with C3 
    Glomerulopathy (C3G) and to fund research focused on this disease. To achieve the 
    first goal, KIDNEEDS hosts an annual C3G Family conference for families living with 
    this rare disease. These two-day events held in Iowa City, IA, are a source of 
    community and support, an opportunity to learn about the latest advances in the 
    treatment of C3G, and a chance to become familiar with on-going C3G-focused research. 
    To achieve the second goal, KIDNEEDS encourages clinical and basic science research 
    initiatives that will lead to a treatment for C3G by financially supporting grants 
    focused on C3G. Appropriate areas of investigation include the diagnosis, management 
    and pathogenesis of this disease. Research studies can involve physiological, 
    biochemical, pharmacological, physical, genetic, or pathological investigations.</P>

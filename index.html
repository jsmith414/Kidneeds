        <h3>Q: What is Kidneeds?</h3>

        <p>A: Kidneeds is a registered nonprofit with the state of Iowa and is a donor advised fund of the Greater Cedar Rapids Community Foundation.  The Community Foundation has 501 (C)(3) status and serves as the fiscal sponsor for the organization.  This partnership allows the donors to access a full range of tax benefits by directing their donations in support of Kidneeds to the Community Foundation. These funds will be deposited in the Kidneeds Fund held there.
        </p>
        

        <h3>Q: Who decides if grants are good enough to be funded?
        </h3>
        <p>A: Kidneeds has two boards, the Board of Scientific Advisors and the Board of Directors. When the grants are submitted to Kidneeds, they are sent to the Board of Scientific Advisors (BSA). The BSA awards a score to each grant application. These scores and grant summaries are then sent to the Kidneeds’ Board of Directors. Kidneeds’ Board of Directors recommends funding based on merit and funding availability. Their recommendation is forwarded to the Greater Cedar Rapids Community Foundation Board of Directors for final funding approval.
        </p>
        
        <h3>Q: How does Kidneeds get money to fund the grants?
        </h3>
        <p>A: 100% of the money donated to Kidneeds is donated by family, friends or patients with C3G.  Kidneeds does not have a fundraising arm. It relies on friends and family to put on benefits for Kidneeds. Since 100% of Kidneeds’ donations go to research, every one who helps with Kidneeds is a volunteer. Administrative and all associated costs are paid for by a private individual.</p>


        <h3>Q: How can I help?
        </h3>
        <p>A: The most important way to help is by donating money to Kidneeds. Kidneeds can receive gifts from the United Way and employee gifts are often matched through a company program. If you would like to host a benefit for Kidneeds, it is important that you first get the benefit guidelines that are put out by the Greater Cedar Rapids Community Foundation. Most of Kidneeds’ benefits have the complete cost of the event donated by the host. We know this is not always possible. Before a benefit is done in Kidneeds’ name, please contact Lynne Lanning at kidneedsMPGN@yahoo.com. There are strict federal guidelines regarding charitable contributions from these events made to the Kidneeds Fund at the Greater Cedar Rapids Community Foundation.    
        </p>
        <p>Since the Greater Cedar Rapids Community Foundation (GCRCF) issues the tax deductible recognition letters, it is necessary that all benefits be approved in advance by them.
        </p>
        

        <h3>Q: Are there research projects that I can participate in?
        </h3>
        <p>A: There are research studies focused on the C3G taking place at the Molecular Otolaryngology & Renal Research Laboratories which include a C3G Natural History Study. To inquire about participating in research opportunities, please contact Monica Hall at monica-hall@uiowa.edu or Richard Smith at richard-smith@uiowa.edu.
